### Git Hooks with *pre-commit*

1. Install once:

   ```
2. From the repo root:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Hooks run automatically on `git commit` ‚Äì they format code, lint, and run quick tests.
4. Update hooks at any time:
   ```bash
   pre-commit autoupdate
   ```

*(If you prefer a different environment manager, adapt accordingly.)*
