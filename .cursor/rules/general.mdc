# General Code Generation Heuristics

# Focus & Conciseness
- Generate code *only* to address the specific task requested. Avoid unrelated changes or additions.
- Keep generated code snippets concise and minimal. Focus on the core logic needed. Prefer first-principle examples.
- Avoid generating excessive boilerplate code (e.g., redundant comments, overly complex setup) unless strictly necessary for functionality.

# Dependency Management
- Do *not* introduce new external libraries or dependencies unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Strongly prefer using built-in functions and modules from the language's standard library whenever they can accomplish the task effectively.

# Scope of Changes
- When modifying existing code, keep changes localized and directly related to the prompt. Avoid refactoring unrelated code sections unless specifically asked.
- If adding new functions or classes, ensure they are directly relevant to the user's request and avoid adding tangential helpers or utilities.

# Assumptions
- Do not make broad assumptions about the project structure or existing utilities unless context clearly provides them. Ask for clarification if necessary.
