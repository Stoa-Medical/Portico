# Portico -- an analytic interface engine and database system

Portico is an agentic interface engine for scalable and efficient data interchange. It has two modes:
1. `server` which starts a server which can run with concurrency and multi-threading
2. `app` which can connect to a server or run locally with an embedded database

Using first-princple design, Portico strives to be both the most performant and user-friendly option on the market.

## Instructions to run
